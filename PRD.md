# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Name

**Agentic Skill Builder**

## Purpose

Agentic Skill Builder is an AI-powered microlearning platform designed to help users learn new skills through bite-sized lessons and adaptive quizzes. The platform leverages Azure OpenAI for content generation, Gradio for user interaction, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) for agent interoperability.

---

## 1. Objectives

- **Deliver Personalized Microlearning:** Provide users with concise, high-quality lessons and adaptive quizzes tailored to their chosen skill.
- **Showcase Agentic Workflows:** Demonstrate how multiple AI agents (lesson generator, quiz generator, progress tracker) can collaborate to enhance learning.
- **Enable Interoperability via MCP:** Allow external agents and applications to interact with the learning modules and user progress through MCP endpoints.
- **Offer a Polished, User-Friendly Interface:** Use Gradio to deliver an intuitive, engaging, and accessible experience.

---

## 2. Target Users

- **Lifelong Learners:** Individuals seeking to acquire or reinforce skills in short, focused sessions.
- **Hackathon Participants:** Developers and researchers interested in agentic workflows and MCP integration.
- **Educational Institutions:** Teachers and trainers looking for AI-driven microlearning tools.
- **Integration Developers:** Teams building apps that could benefit from plug-and-play learning modules.

## 3. Features \& Requirements

### 3.1 Core Features

#### 3.1.1 Skill Selection

- Users can select from a list of predefined skills (e.g., Python, Spanish, Public Speaking) or enter a custom skill/topic.


#### 3.1.2 Micro-Lesson Delivery

- For the chosen skill, the system generates and presents a concise, focused lesson (text, optionally with links to videos or code snippets).
- Lessons are generated dynamically using Azure OpenAI.


#### 3.1.3 Adaptive Quiz

- After each lesson, users receive a short quiz (e.g., multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank) tailored to the lesson content.
- The quiz adapts in difficulty based on user performance over time.


#### 3.1.4 Progress Tracking

- The system tracks user progress (e.g., lessons completed, quiz accuracy, streaks).
- Progress is displayed visually (e.g., progress bars, charts).


#### 3.1.5 Recommendations

- Based on performance, the system recommends the next lesson, a review session, or an increased difficulty level.


### 3.2 Agentic Architecture

- **Lesson Agent:** Generates concise lessons for the selected skill.
- **Quiz Agent:** Creates contextually relevant quizzes based on the lesson.
- **Progress Agent:** Monitors and updates user progress, provides feedback, and recommends next steps.
- **Orchestrator:** Coordinates the flow between agents and the user interface.


### 3.3 MCP Integration

- Expose endpoints for:
    - Fetching the next lesson for a user/skill.
    - Retrieving user progress data.
    - Submitting quiz results.
- Ensure endpoints are documented and compatible with the Model Context Protocol.


### 3.4 User Interface

- **Built with Gradio:**
    - Step-by-step workflow: Skill selection → Lesson → Quiz → Feedback/Progress.
    - Clean, accessible design with clear navigation.
    - Responsive for desktop and mobile.

---

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Lessons and quizzes should be generated in under 5 seconds.
- **Scalability:** Support at least 100 concurrent users for demo purposes.
- **Security:** User data (progress, answers) is stored securely and not shared without consent.
- **Accessibility:** UI should be usable with screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- **Reliability:** System should handle API failures gracefully and provide user-friendly error messages.

---

## 5. Optional \& Stretch Features

- **Speech-to-Text Input:** For language practice, allow users to answer quizzes verbally.
- **Leaderboard:** Display top learners (opt-in).
- **Daily Reminders:** Send notifications or emails to encourage regular learning.
- **Custom Content Upload:** Allow educators to add their own lesson modules.
- **Multi-modal Lessons:** Incorporate images, audio, or video if supported by Azure OpenAI.

---

## 6. Technical Stack

- **Backend:** Azure OpenAI (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, or GPT-4o)
- **Frontend:** Gradio (Python)
- **MCP Integration:** Gradio MCP server functionality
- **Data Storage:** In-memory or lightweight database (for hackathon demo)
- **Deployment:** Hugging Face Spaces or Azure App Service

---

## 7. Success Metrics

- **User Engagement:** Number of lessons/quizzes completed per user.
- **Learning Outcomes:** Improvement in quiz scores over sessions.
- **MCP Usage:** Number of successful external calls to MCP endpoints.
- **User Satisfaction:** Positive feedback from hackathon judges and users.

## 8. Risks \& Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
| :-- | :-- |
| Slow response from Azure OpenAI | Cache common lessons/quizzes, optimize prompts |
| User data loss (demo) | Regular backups, clear communication |
| MCP integration complexity | Use official Gradio MCP templates and docs |
| Overly generic lessons/quizzes | Refine prompts, add manual review if possible |
