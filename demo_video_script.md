## üé® **Gradio Interface Demo (2:00 - 3:30)**

### Part 1: Learning Flow (2:00 - 3:00)
**Visual:** Gradio interface at localhost:7860
**Narration:**
> "Now let's see the beautiful Gradio interface in action. The same AI agents that power our MCP endpoints create this seamless learning experience."

**Action:** 
1. Select "Data Science" skill
2. Click "Start Learning"
3. Show generated lesson content
4. Complete lesson and start quiz
5. Answer quiz questions
6. Show results and progress

### Part 2: MCP Testing Interface (3:00 - 3:30)
